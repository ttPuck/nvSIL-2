# A (Hopefully) Faithful Replica of the Best Note Taking App: nvALT, Running on Apple Silicon This Time!

### A Brief History of nvALT and It’s Impact on the Note-Taking Scene and Myself
nvALT is a fork of an older application for macOS named "Notational Velocity" (circa 2005, created by Zachary Schneirov), an Objective-C application that gained popularity for it's lightning fast incremental search capabilities and emphasis on keyboard shortcuts. nvALT (circa 2010, created by Brett Terpstra) improved file handling, added markdown support, and added live preview capabilities.

I have been a PKM's nightmare for the past decade trying to decipher the best note taking system for my brain, and then I discovered nvALT. The initial system developed by Zachary Schneirov, then modified by Brett Terpstra to make the UX/UI more up to date with cursor involvement clicked with my brain instantly. My brain remembers things in clusters, and struggles with folders. Having all of my notes at my finger tips, able to search for a tag, a keyword, or a title instantly anywhere from my mac had me in a chokehold. 

I didn't even notice the application was layering through rosetta at first on my M1 Air, which is where this project comes in.
# Developed in Swift Using Storyboard UI, Compiled for Apple Silicon
nvSIL is aimed to be a faster (around 20-30%), modern, and Silicon native version of nvALT. It is not a fork, as nvALT (being a fork of Notational Veloctiy) was written in Objective-C, and is a separate application from the ground up.
